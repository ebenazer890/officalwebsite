# 🌐 Ebenazer's Official Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **official portfolio**! This site showcases the projects, websites, and tech experiments I’ve built as a final-year **AI & Data Science** student. I’m passionate about turning ideas into real-world solutions using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and other technologies.
